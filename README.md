# Power BI Projects - Visualization
These are my Power BI projects which showcase my data analytical skills:

1. **[Blinkit Online Groceries Store Analysis](https://github.com/trareinaung/Blinkit-Dashboard/blob/main/README.md)**  
  This project showcases a Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, an online groceries store. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the store's performance across various dimensions, such as total sales, item types, outlet sizes, and locations. The primary objective of this dashboard is to enable stakeholders to gain actionable insights into the store's operations, helping them make informed decisions.
